# Telemetry

The codes existing in this repository are part of my Diploma Thesis ("Design of a Telemetry System", F.Zafeiris, NTUA)
There are drivers for NRF24L01, H3LIS100DLTR, LSM9DS1, MCP9800, IS25LP128F, as well as a main code for my operation in STM32F401RET6.
Also there is some code for the TESEO-LIV3F, not operational yet (maybe in a future update!).
