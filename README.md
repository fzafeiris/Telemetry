# Telemetry

The codes existing in this repository are part of my Diploma Thesis ("Design of a Telemetry System", F.Zafeiris, NTUA)
I have included two STM32F401RET projects , one for the transmitter and one for the receiver.
In the receiver project there are drivers for NRF24L01, H3LIS100DLTR, LSM9DS1, MCP9800, IS25LP128F.
Also there is some code for the TESEO-LIV3F, not operational yet (maybe in a future update!).
